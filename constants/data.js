      description: "For the project that was given in my first year at Thomas More for Webdesign Advanced, me and my colleague designed a website for a lifestyle studio named 'Power Up Fitness'. Normally this project was meant to made by 3 persons but 1 colleague decided to quit his traject. This meant that we needed to work harder to achieve a good result. Me and my colleague splitted the work equally and delivered a very nice website. I learned a lot of new things such as using Github as workflow, building a responsive website, a navigation menu with JavaScript and much more! I'm very proud of the results and I hope to learn much more in the feature. Make sure to click on my project to see it yourself!",

      description: "As you can see in the photo section. I created subscription plans for customers to join Power Up Fitness. In the down right corner there is a 'To top of page' button that I also created. At first it looks simple but this button only shows itself when you are not on top of the page. I created this with Java Script. A big challenge where I learned a lot from. Together with my colleague we created a special navigation menu that is transparent when you are on top of the page but when you start scrolling this gradually changes to a black background. One of the hardest things in this project I must say.",

      description: "For the project \"KVV Rauw,\" assigned during my project week at Thomas More for Requirements Analysis, I collaborated with a group of seven highly motivated students. Our objective was multifaceted: we aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the requirements through analysis. This involved creating intricate use case diagrams, crafting a robust data model, and designing prototypes that aligned seamlessly with the envisioned functionality. Through effective communication and coordination, we navigated the intricacies of the project, ensuring alignment with the client's expectations and objectives. Reflecting on the journey, I am immensely proud of the results we achieved as a team. Make sure to click on my project to see it yourself!",
