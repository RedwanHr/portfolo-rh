    description: [
      <>In my second year, I embarked on an exciting deep learning project: building an AI image predictor capable of distinguishing between five distinct wild cat species: <strong>lions</strong>, <strong>tigers</strong>, <strong>cheetahs</strong>, <strong>Siberian tigers</strong>, and <strong>leopards</strong>.</>,
      <>Leveraging the power of <strong>Keras</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, I dived into advanced transfer learning techniques. Rather than simply using a pre-trained model as a black box, I strategically unfroze specific layers and meticulously retrained the network from scratch on my custom dataset. This hands-on approach allowed me to fine-tune the model's feature extraction capabilities specifically for the subtle nuances of feline anatomy.</>,
      <>The true test came with the striking similarities between <strong>cheetahs</strong> and <strong>leopards</strong>. This inherent visual ambiguity presented a significant challenge, pushing the boundaries of the model's discriminative power. While achieving an impressive overall accuracy of <strong>0.96</strong>, the project provided invaluable insights into the complexities of visual classification, especially when dealing with highly analogous classes.</>

      <>For the <strong>KVV Rauw</strong> project during <strong>project week</strong> at <strong>Thomas More</strong>, I collaborated with <strong>seven motivated students</strong> to conduct a comprehensive <strong>requirements analysis</strong>.</>,
      <>We produced detailed <strong>use case diagrams</strong>, a robust <strong>data model</strong>, and interactive <strong>prototypes</strong> to reflect real-world application flow and user needs.</>,
      <>The experience emphasized the value of <strong>teamwork</strong>, <strong>client communication</strong>, and delivering a solution that meets expectations. I’m really proud of our result — take a look!</>

    description: [
        <>I've always been drawn to creating practical tools that solve everyday problems. That drive led me to develop this intuitive <strong>Task Manager application</strong> using <strong>C#</strong> and a <strong>SQLite database</strong>.</>,
        <>This project allowed me to build a seamless experience for organizing tasks, featuring a user-friendly interface for input and display, robust local database functionality for persistent storage, and essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.</>,
        <>It was an an excellent hands-on exercise in <strong>Windows Forms development</strong>, solidifying my understanding of UI/UX design principles in desktop applications, and provided invaluable experience working with efficient, embedded databases like SQLite. This project truly enhanced my capabilities in <strong>full-stack desktop application development</strong>.</>

    description: [
      <>For the project in my first year at <strong>Thomas More</strong> for <strong>Webdesign Advanced</strong>, my colleague and I designed a website for a lifestyle studio named <strong>Power Up Fitness</strong>.</>,
      <>Originally meant for a team of three, we continued as two after one teammate left the program. This challenge pushed us to work even harder and split the responsibilities equally.</>,
      <>Throughout this project, I learned many new skills such as using <strong>GitHub</strong> for collaboration, building a <strong>responsive website</strong>, creating a <strong>JavaScript-based navigation menu</strong>, and more. I’m very proud of the final product and the experience gained. Check it out!</>

      <>In the screenshot, you’ll notice the <strong>subscription plans</strong> section, which I developed to allow customers to join Power Up Fitness. In the lower right corner, I also implemented a <strong>“To top of page” button</strong>.</>,
      <>Although it looks simple, the button only appears when the user scrolls down — a feature I created using <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</>,
      <>Another challenge was building a <strong>dynamic navigation menu</strong> that starts as transparent and turns black while scrolling. This was one of the trickiest parts of the entire project and taught me a lot.</>
